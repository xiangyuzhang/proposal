%%     proposal    -- indicates that this document is a dissertation proposal,

%%     allowlisthypenation -- (the default), allows hyphenation of words in
%%                    the table of contents, the list of figures, and the list
%%                    of tables.  I believe that this is acceptable to the

This study was performed with two main goals in mind. The first goal was to implement the four current main stream gate-level circuit camouflage algorithms as well as their performance. The second goal was to implement the Oracle-guided incremental de-camouflage algorithm. 

The four circuit camouflage algorithms are implemented by Python, and the Oracle-guided incremental de-camouflage algorithm is implemented by C++. During this study, I tested the Oracle-guided de-camouflage tool (Solver, in short) performance by using it to de-obfuscate ISCAS-85 combinational benchmarks when camouflaged using the four camouflage algorithms. The results show that  Solver is able to efficiently de-obfuscate the ISCAS-85 benchmarks regardless of camouflaging style, and are able to do so 10.5x faster than the best existing approaches. And, based on Solver, this study also measured the performance for each camouflage algorithms. \end{abstract}

\chapter{Incremental SAT-based Reverse Engineering of Camouflaged Logic Circuits}
%%Is there life after sheep?~\cite{xyz}  Yes, I say there is.%\marginpar{Really?}
        As countermeasures against reverse engineering of combinational logic, layout-level gate or routing camouflaging techniques have increasingly attracted interests. The security of camouflaging relies on the difficulty of learning the overall combinational logic function without knowing the functions implemented by the individual camouflaged components of the circuit.

        In this study, I use incremental SAT solver to reconstruct the logical function of a circuit with camouflaged components. The algorithm used the standard attacker model in which an adversary knows only the non-camouflaged component functions, and has the ability to query the circuit to learn the correct output vector for any input vector. To test the performance, I use three different proposed styles of camouflaging \cite{1}, \cite{2}, \cite{3}. This study will give results to quantify the effectiveness of camouflaging techniques on a variety of ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits.
\section{Introduction}
    IC designers have clear incentives against publicizing all implementation details of a design, as this may compromise their strategic advantage or leak sensitive information. However, once a circuit is fabricated and released to market, reverse engineering techniques can attempt to extract implementation details from the physical object without consent or knowledge of the designer. Circuit camouflaging is an attempt to obscure the true functionality of a circuit, and to limit the information that can be leaked through reverse engineering.
    
    Gate-level camouflaging is a particular camouflaging tech- nique in which the functions of certain combinational logic gates cannot be directly ascertained from imaging-based reverse engineering. In this case, the logic may be inferred using a combination of information obtained from reverse engineering and information obtained through observation of input-output vectors captured through scan chains or other mechanisms. In this paper we present such an algorithm for extracting the functionality of reverse engineered netlists.

Lots of text here just to fill up some space so we can be sure that we
really are double-spacing and doing all the other things that might be
necessary in formatting a dissertation to U.Mass. guidelines.  We're
also going to have another figure here, figure \ref{fig:disc}, just
for fun, and to make sure that the list of figures is formatted
correctly.  Now it's time for table \ref{table:somenumbers}.  We
really are going to need a third figure, figure \ref{fig:discs}, two
more tables, table \ref{table:morenumbers} and table
\ref{table:evenmorenumbers} and a fourth figure, figure
\ref{fig:circleanddisc}, just to really make sure.
