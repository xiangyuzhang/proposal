  Abstract                 = {To head-off the trend of increasing power con- sumption and throughput overheads due to refresh in DRAM, researchers are exploring ways to fine-tune refresh rate. Refresh management proposals range from temperature-aware refresh to partitioning data cells based on volatility, with each partition having its own refresh rate. One hurdle in this area is the lack of precise description of the evaluation setups used in current proposals. The incomplete descrip- tion makes it difficult to reproduce reproduce results and compare approaches. Thus, it is common for researchers to evaluate their approach using mathe- matical models derived on the experimental results from a disparate set of platforms.
To aide in the evaluation of existing and future ap- proaches for tuning DRAM refresh to save power, this paper provides a reproducible DRAM research plat- form. On this platform, we re-run commonly cited experiments from previous papers in the area. Our experimental results highlight the necessity of a re- producible platform by showing how both assump- tions and experimental outcomes are sensitive to of- ten omitted parameters like temperature and refresh duration.

  Abstract                 = {Lack of a locally trustworthy clock makes security protocols challenging to implement on batteryless embedded devices such as contact smartcards, contactless smartcards, and RFID tags. A device that knows how much time has elapsed between queries from an untrusted reader could better protect against attacks that depend on the existence of a rate-unlimited encryption oracle. The TARDIS (Time and Remanence Decay in SRAM) helps to locally maintain a sense of time elapsed without power and without special-purpose hardware. The TARDIS software computes the expiration state of a timer by analyzing the decay of existing on-chip SRAM memory. The TARDIS enables coarse-grained, hourglass-like timers such that cryptographic software can more deliberately decide how to throttle its response rate. Our experiments demonstrate that the TARDIS can measure time ranging from seconds to several hours depending on hardware parameters. Key challenges to implementing a practical TARDIS include compensating for temperature and handling variation across hardware. Our contributions are (1) the algorithmic building blocks for computing elapsed time from SRAM decay; (2) characterizing TARDIS behavior under different temperatures, capacitors, SRAM sizes, and chips; and (3) three proof of concept implementations that use the TARDIS to enable privacy-preserving RFID tags, to deter double swiping of contactless credit cards, and to increase the difficulty of brute force attacks against e-Passports.},
